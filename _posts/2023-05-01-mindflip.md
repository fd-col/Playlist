# Mindflip

Born with Tourette’s Syndrome and ADHD, Mindflip was told that keeping up with others would always be difficult. At 19 a critical realization shifted his fear of being limited by his conditions into using them as strengths. He decided he would no longer dwell on the negative and convert his weaknesses into tools “The only limitations we have are the ones we set ourselves.”⁣

⁣While travelling the western regions of Canada on a summer hiatus with friends, Mindflip took this mentality further and discovered the force of meditation. He was introduced to the capabilities of channelling higher frequencies which manifested themselves through melodies. In this moment Mindflip was sparked with love for music and has since then dedicated himself to the craft. ⁣

⁣Through his songs, millions of listeners are immersed in heartfelt vibrations and powerful sonics. These Energetic frequencies translate into gratitude, compassion, chasing dreams and in some cases “EVERYTHING IS ENERGY, it’s just about having a good time on earth.” ⁣
